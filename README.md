Windows openSUSE installer

## description
If you want to install openSUSE to the Windows machine, you can use the install CD or DVD.
But it takes some time to download and burn ISO.

Instlux can reduce this waiting time. 
This Windows app can prepare needed images and configure the Windows bootloader to start
installation.

In addition, if your computer cannot boot from CD nor DVD for some reason,
instlux can help you, too.

## note
Instlux only prepares the installation environment.
It does not handle an installation process itself and does not cover an uninstallation.

If you want to uninstall Linux with dual boot setting,
please remove Linux partitions and fix bootloader manually.
(Fixing bootloader probably need to run Windows setup which is holded in installation DVD or recovery partition).
